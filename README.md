# Phase 2 – Cognitive Layer
Phase 2 extends the **Autonomous CI/CD Intelligence Framework** by introducing a meta-cognitive reasoning layer. This layer enables adaptive intelligence, predictive analytics, and dynamic orchestration across distributed autonomous agents. It builds upon Phase 1 – System Laws, using its deterministic rule base as a foundation for self-learning and real-time decision evolution.
## Core Functions
- Autonomous cognitive orchestration and agent coordination  
- Predictive learning and real-time adaptation  
- State-driven decision modeling  
- Deep semantic context processing  
- Reinforcement-based behavior optimization  
## Architecture
Phase 2 – Cognitive Layer functions as the intelligence core of the multi-phase system, integrating high-level reasoning with operational control. Through deep feedback loops and adaptive learning heuristics, this layer refines the behavioral models defined by Phase 1, enabling context-aware responses and proactive system evolution.
## Installation & Usage
Clone the repository and navigate into the source directories to explore live orchestration logic, learning pipelines, and cognitive state models.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thegrimdeveloper/Phase-2-Cognitive-Layer.git
cd Phase-2-Cognitive-Layer
